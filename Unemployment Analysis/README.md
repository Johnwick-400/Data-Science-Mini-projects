***UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS*** 

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.
